<h1>So you want to build an App in 2016</h1>

<div class="intro">
  <p>This post is slightly a backlash towards the constant “lol JS ecosystem posts” — I thought it might be nice to write a “heres a list of useful ways if you are new to tech/are nervous about areas/etc.”<p>
  <p>This is mainly aimed as a list of tools/resources to help someone thinking of building a web application — I am not familiar enough with mobile dev to suggest native app solutions.</p>

<div class="main">
  <p>So you have an idea that you want to turn into a functional application, good news — many people have been in a similar situation before, and as such have developed tools and solutions to issues you are likely to face. First question: how much experience do you have?

  <ul>
    <li>I have never done any web development</li>
    <li>I have done some work with HTML & CSS</li>
    <li>I have done some coding as a hobby</li>
    <li>I do FE professionally and want to know how to build a back-end</li>
    <li>I do BE professionally and want to know how to build the front-end</li>
    <li>I am a full stack developer and want to know how to host my application</li>
  </ul>
</div>
